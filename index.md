# Event Driven Banking with UP Bank
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/codecowboydotio/event-driven-banking/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

## What is this?
Recetly, a neo bank that I am a member of released a new API. 
This API has the usual banking related functions, get your account details, view your transactions and so on.

The developer docs are available here: https://developer.up.com.au

What caught my eye though was this: https://developer.up.com.au/#get_webhooks

## A lightbulb moment

When I read about arbitrary webhooks for my bank account, a lightbulb went off in my head.
I can do **anything** with an arbitrary webhook.

It occurred to me that by sending data in a real time fashion to an **arbitrary** **webhook** that what the UP team had done was create a situation where I could start to use **real time event driven banking**.
